## SeedLab

### Task 1

- We started by downloading the seed lab that has two containers, one for hosting the web application, and the other for hosting the
database for the web application.

- After finishing the set up and building the containers, in order to interact with a container we need to run commands so we need to get a shell on the Mysql container. In order to do that and with the help of the aliases in the .bashrc file, we list the containers that are running with the command ``dockps`` to find out the ID of the container where we want to start a shell. The command ``docksh <id>`` starts the shell.
