### Task 1

- For the task 1, we choose to login with the user Alice. After we logged in we went to edit profile and in the input for brief discreption we add the script ``<script>alert('XSS');</script>``.

- This way, every time the brief discreption field is asked for a web page, it will execute the alert we inserted. This justifies why even in the list of users the alert is triggered. Because this list not only the users, but the brief discreption of each user.
